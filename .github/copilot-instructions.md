# Copilot Instructions for Essential-Elementz

## Project Overview
This repository currently contains minimal structure (only a LICENSE file is present). No code, documentation, or project-specific configuration files were found. The following instructions are provided as a starting point for AI coding agents and should be updated as the project evolves.

## Getting Started
- If you are initializing the project, create a `README.md` at the root to describe the project's purpose, architecture, and setup steps.
- Place all new source code in a clearly named directory (e.g., `src/` or `app/`).
- Use standard open source project conventions unless otherwise specified in future documentation.

## Directory and File Conventions
- Place GitHub workflows and project-level instructions in the `.github/` directory.
- Add project documentation and onboarding guides as the codebase grows.

## AI Agent Guidance
- If you add new files, update this `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect new patterns, workflows, or conventions.
- When introducing build, test, or CI/CD workflows, document the required commands and tools here.
- Reference key files and directories as they are created to help future agents understand the project structure.

## Next Steps
- As the project develops, revisit and expand these instructions to capture essential knowledge, unique patterns, and critical workflows.
